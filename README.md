# Getting Started
To begin working on the project, please follow these steps:

Download the meme dataset from the provided link.

Implement and train three classifiers for image sentiment classification using the dataset. Additionally, develop three classifiers for text sentiment classification using the same dataset. Utilize the sklearn library for training the classifiers.

Calculate the confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-measure for the five classifiers you have trained. This evaluation will assess the performance of the classifiers.

Start developing the Flask web application. Utilize the Flask framework to create a user-friendly interface for the project. The web application should allow users to input a meme and receive the corresponding sentiment classification as output.

Pay attention to the aesthetics and presentation of the web application. Creating an appealing and user-friendly interface will positively impact the evaluation of your project.

Test the web application thoroughly to ensure its functionality and accuracy.

Make sure you have given the right path of folders.
